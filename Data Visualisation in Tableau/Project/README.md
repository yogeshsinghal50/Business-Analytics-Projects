Project Overview

In this project, you'll use Tableau to build dashboards and tell a story
with data. This is an essential skill as an analyst. You'll be exploring
data from Lending Club, a peer to peer lending platform.

You'll start by defining some leading questions, then you'll explore the
data to find answers, and finally build visualizations to communicate
those answers and tell a story.

Lending Club Data Lending Club provides their loan data for public use,
you can find it here:

Project Details

You're an analyst at Lending Club assigned to analyze loan data. Your
manager has requested you to investigate the data to answer three main
questions:

- How do the attributes differ between borrowers who pay back their
loans versus those who don't? - How do accepted and rejected loan data
differ among different locations? - How have issued loans changed over
time?

On top of that, your manager has requested that you pick another
question of your own to explore and report on.

Data 

The Lending Club data includes three files found at the bottom of
the page:

LoanStats3a - This shows the data for loans accepted by Lending Club.

RejectStatsA - This shows the data for loans rejected by Lending Club.

LCData Dictionary - This explains what each of the variables in the both
datasets represents. Use this to understand the variables as you explore
the data to find answers to the questions.
