Project Details 

You work for a retail store chain that only has a
presence of stores in the United States. The company is thinking of
expanding to other countries, but would like to start this process with
countries that are similar economically and demographically to the
United States.

Your manager has asked you to segment the countries of the world based
on various economic, demographic, education, and environment data. From
this you should be able to provide a list of countries that are similar
to the United States. This will be the “short list” for further
consideration by management.

You have the following information to work with:

A set of various data taken from the World Bank web site. A clean
version of this data is included with the supporting materials.
