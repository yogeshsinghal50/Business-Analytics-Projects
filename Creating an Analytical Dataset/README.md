The Problem:

Part 1

Project Overview This project is the first part of a two-part series. In
the first part, you will blend and format data and deal with outliers.

For the second part, you will use your cleaned up dataset to create
another linear regression model. The difference this time is that you
will have to choose which variable(s) are the most important for the
model using new techniques learned in the More on Predictor Variables
lesson.
