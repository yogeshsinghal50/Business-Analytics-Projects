Capstone Project Overview 

The capstone project has three main tasks,
each of which requires you to use skills you developed during the
nanodegree program. Once you complete all three tasks, please submit the
project as a PDF.

Tips Split up your Alteryx workflows: You will be using multiple data
sources and complex tools, which can slow down the workflow runtime.
Splitting up the workflows makes the process more manageable. 

Map out your work: Before you dive into your analysis, think about the steps and
plan ahead. This will reduce the amount of unnecessary work. 

Use visualizations: Include visualizations to help explain your decisions
and communicate your findings. Remember what you learned about making
them look great!
