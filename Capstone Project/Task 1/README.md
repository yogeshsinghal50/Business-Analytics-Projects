Task 1: 

Store Format for Existing Stores Your company currently has 85
grocery stores and is planning to open 10 new stores at the beginning of
the year. Currently, all stores use the same store format for selling
their products. Up until now, the company has treated all stores
similarly, shipping the same amount of product to each store. This is
beginning to cause problems as stores are suffering from product
surpluses in some product categories and shortages in others. You've
been asked to provide analytical support to make decisions about store
formats and inventory planning.

Task 1:

Determining Store Format To remedy the product surplus and shortages,
the company wants to introduce different store formats. Each store
format will have a different product selection in order to better match
local demand. The actually building sizes will not change, just the
production selection and internal layouts. The terms formats and
segments will be used interchangeably throughout this project.
