Task 2: 

Store Format for New Stores The grocery store chain is has 10
new stores opening up at the beginning of the year. The company wants to
determine which store format each of the new stores should have.
However, we don’t have sales data for these new stores yet, so we’ll
have to determine the format using each of the new store’s demographic
data.
